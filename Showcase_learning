* I had a question regarding months ago regarding how a webpage can "expand" when a part of the project would take the whole space.

  Admitely, I was working on a project poorly styled with ONLY grid. Was just starting to learn it. To my suprise, I ran out of space, and couldn't find an answer on how to "make more space available" so I don't have to cram everything inside the DOM.

  In this project, I learned that if working with CSS units, such as viewport units(v), it will be relative to the content of the parents thus will allow you  to "cram" more content.

  Here, it is shown with the header element with a showcase class, we assigned a 93 vh, so it pretty much took over the whole screen. As one progressed through the project, added more objects, such as the Font Awesome icon for the tab elements. That "expanded" the DOM.
